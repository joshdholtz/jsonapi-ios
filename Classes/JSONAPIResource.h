/**
 Get the JSON API resource metadata description. This will be different for each resource
 model class. It must be defined by the subclass.

 The definition should look something like:
 
 <pre><code>
      #import &lt;JSONAPI/JSONAPIPropertyDescriptor.h&gt;
      #import &lt;JSONAPI/JSONAPIResourceDescriptor.h&gt;
 
      @implementation PeopleResource

      static JSONAPIResourceDescriptor *__descriptor = nil;

      + (JSONAPIResourceDescriptor*)descriptor {
         static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
         dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
           __descriptor = [[JSONAPIResourceDescriptor alloc] initWithClass:[self class] forLinkedType:@"people"];

           [__descriptor setIdProperty:@"ID"];

           [__descriptor addProperty:@"telephone"];
           [__descriptor addProperty:@"birthday" withDescription:[[JSONAPIPropertyDescriptor alloc] initWithJsonName:@"birthday" withFormat:[NSDateFormatter RFC3339DateFormatter]]];
           [__descriptor addProperty:@"firstName" withDescription:[[JSONAPIPropertyDescriptor alloc] initWithJsonName:@"first"]];
           [__descriptor addProperty:@"lastName" withDescription:[[JSONAPIPropertyDescriptor alloc] initWithJsonName:@"last"]];
         });

         return __descriptor;
       }
 </code></pre>

 In this example, `PeopleResource` is a class that inherits from <JSONAPIResourceBase>
 (defines property 'ID'), and defines properties `NSString *telephone`, `NSDate *birthday`,
 `NSString *firstName` and `NSString *lastName`. 
 
 * The `telephone` property needs no special transform rules. 
 * The `birthday` property must be transformed into a string for JSON. 
 * The API you are targeting uses the labels `first` and `last` for the last two properties,
 which you prefer to relabel internally.

 @return Resource description for the target model class.

 * property in the JSON body, and the JSON value is always a string URL.
 *
 * In general, this should be implemented by a @property selfLink in the realized class. The 
 * @property declaration will automatically synthesize the get/set members declared in this
